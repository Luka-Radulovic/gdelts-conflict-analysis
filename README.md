#  Global confilcts prediction, and analysis of the relations between countries using GDELT database

For the course `Introduction to Data Science` we develop a centralized application that simultaneously aggregates and stores scraped data from the contributors into a single database.  
This app not only facilitates efficient data collection able to retrieve 2.5TB of GDELT data, but also provides a platform to analyze and visualize relationships between countries, enhancing our understanding of global interactions.
